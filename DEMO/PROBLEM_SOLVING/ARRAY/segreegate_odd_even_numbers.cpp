/*
Given an array A[], write a function that segregates even and odd numbers. The functions should put all even numbers first, and then odd numbers.

Example

Input  = {12, 34, 45, 9, 8, 90, 3}
Output = {12, 34, 8, 90, 45, 9, 3} 

1st solution that comes in my mind- count odd numbers and even numbers then divide array in two parts since we know the exact count
